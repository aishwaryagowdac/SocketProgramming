This project is intended to familiarize with writing simple network code. I have implemented a client program that plays a variant of the recently-popular game Wordle. The program will make guesses for the secret word, and the server will give information about how close the guess is. Once the client correctly guesses the word, the server will return a secret flag. 
The client supports TLS encrypted sockets. The server will return different secret flags depending on whether the client communicates with or without TLS.

My high-level approach for solving Wordle was to maintain a list of valid guesses and randomly make selections from it, using the results to adjust the list as appropriate. While in actual Wordle games it is sometimes advantageous to guess a completely incorrect word to rule out common letters, I chose to go with my method since it would be much easier to implement. To do this, my code randomly picks a word from the list, removes it from the list, and submits it as a guess using the sendMsg() method. If the word was right, I’m done; if not, I call the updateWordList() method, which uses the info in the guess to cross invalid words off the list. This method is well-optimized; once a character of the final word 
is known, it is removed from the “unknown” list so that we never check that slot again. Then, we repeat until we win.
